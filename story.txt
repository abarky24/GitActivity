  Once, there were 6 members of a group in a computer science class. They all worked very hard on their project together because they wanted to get an A in the class. They were working on putting together an algorithm to hash data for classes at the university.
  The 6 group members decided to meet together one day to discuss what they would be doing on their projects and to divide up work. The 6 group members met at their local library to finalize their goals. The group members decided to split up their work by making 2 group members work on the add() method  and its tests in their hashtable project, 2 working on the get() method and its respective tests, and the last 2 working on any other helper methods along with their test methods.
